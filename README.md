# Super-High-resolution-and-Segmentation-Deep-Learning-for-Cancer-Histopathology-image-Analysis


We demonstrate the convolution neural network (CNN) for improving the quality of image resolution for hematoxylin and eosin(H&E) stained breast cancer histopathology images. According to the development of imaging technology, the microscope can acquire high-resolution images, but the size of those images is substantially large. Therefore, it is not comfortable to handle, manipulate, and transfer those files across a network or computer storage. In addition, this CNN can tackle the shortage of advance microscopes in some clinical laboratories because it can be used to improve the image quality from the low-cost microscope as well. Apart from enhancing the image quality, another CNN network is also applied to those enhanced images in order to characterize the cell and nuclei by automatic segmentation.  The purpose of this network is to facilitate the phonologist to diagnose the cancer effortlessly and provide some useful information to identify which cells are supposed to be canner or normal cells. Therefore, this work not only enhance the image quality from the poor-resolution images, but also quantitative the cell and nuclei from the enhanced images.
